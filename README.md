 # Heart Attack Prediction Project

This project demonstrates an interactive workflow for predicting heart disease using machine learning in Python. The notebook guides you through:

- **Data Loading**: Import and preview the heart disease dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize and understand the data, including distributions, missing values, and correlations.
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handle missing/zero values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Prepare the data for modeling.
- **Model Building & Evaluation**: (To be added) Train and evaluate machine learning models.

## How to Use
1. Open `prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter or VS Code.
2. Run each cell in order. Markdown cells provide explanations for each step.
3. Visualizations and outputs will appear below each code cell for interactive exploration.

## Features
- **Step-by-step workflow**: Each section is clearly marked and explained.
- **Interactive visualizations**: Use matplotlib and seaborn for data exploration.
- **Easy customization**: Modify code cells to experiment with different preprocessing or modeling techniques.
- **Well-commented code**: Inline markdown and code comments for clarity.
